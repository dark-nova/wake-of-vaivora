# Wake of Vaivora

## Overview

**Wake of Vaivora** is a supplementary app to use with [**Wings of Vaivora**](https://github.com/dark-nova/wings-of-vaivora). It does **not** do anything on its own or when Wings of Vaivora runs on a separate system (without tweaks). This app can be thought as a low-tech frontend for managing uptime on Wings of Vaivora.

## Requirements

This code is designed around the following:

- Python 3.6+
    - `flask`
    - `uWSGI`
    - other [requirements](requirements.txt)
- Linux
    - `sudo` and `sudoers`
    - `systemd` unit files for both **Wake** and **Wings of Vaivora** and `systemctl`
    - (preferable) `nginx` to ultimately serve the page

âš  I realize that `systemd` can be controversial so should the need arise, I will look into compatibility with `rc.d` and other init-like management tools.

## Setup

Set up your environment for self-hosting. Read [Requirements](#Requirements) for dependencies.
Python `venv` is highly recommended for managing your files, including dependencies.
Like so:

```
$ git clone <url> && cd wake-of-vaivora
$ # venv may be installable in package management.
$ # For Debian-like distros, `apt install python3-venv`
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $ # See directly below for setting up your config.
```

To set up your configuration, copy [`config.yaml.example`](config.yaml.example) into `config.yaml` and change all the fields according to your build. I have left some defaults that may be preferred.

If everything is set up correctly, navigate to your page defined by `config.yaml` (`uri`) and click the button. Results below:

- ![OK](OK.png): **success**; Wings of Vaivora should have restarted
- ![Fail 1](tired.png): **fail**; Wings of Vaivora is already running
- ![Fail 2](angery.png): **fail**; Wings of Vaivora was not running but could not restart

Ideally, you should also have sudo password-less permissions, preferably via `sudoers` and the specific command(s).
